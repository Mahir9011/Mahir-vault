## 4.1 What are Enzymes?
- **Enzymes**: Biological catalysts made of proteins.
- **Properties**:
  - Speed up reactions.
  - Not used up in the reaction.
  - Specific to one substrate.

## 4.2 Enzyme Action
- **Lock and Key Model**: Enzymes have an active site where the substrate fits.

## 4.3 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
- **Temperature**: Higher temperature increases enzyme activity until optimum temperature (~37Â°C), after which denaturation occurs.
- **pH**: Each enzyme has an optimum pH. Extreme pH can denature enzymes.
- **Substrate Concentration**: Increases enzyme activity until saturation (all active sites are occupied).

## 4.4 Enzymes in Metabolic Reactions
- **Examples**:
  - **Amylase**: Breaks down starch to maltose.
  - **Protease**: Breaks down proteins to amino acids.
  - **Lipase**: Breaks down fats to fatty acids and glycerol.

## 4.5 Denaturation
- **Denaturation**: Irreversible change in enzyme shape due to high temperature or extreme pH.
