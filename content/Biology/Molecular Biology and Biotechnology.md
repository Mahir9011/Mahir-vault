## 21.1 DNA and Genes
- **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**: The molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It consists of two strands forming a double helix structure.
- **Genes**: Specific sequences of nucleotides within DNA that code for proteins.
- **Structure of DNA**:
  - **Nucleotides**: Building blocks of DNA, each consisting of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine).
  - **Base Pairing**: Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).

## 21.2 Protein Synthesis
- **Protein Synthesis**: The process by which cells make proteins based on the information in DNA.
  - **Transcription**: In the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA).
  - **Translation**: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes translate the mRNA code into a sequence of amino acids to form a protein.
- **Codons**: Triplets of bases in mRNA that correspond to specific amino acids.

## 21.3 Genetic Code
- **The Genetic Code**: The set of rules by which the sequence of bases in DNA is translated into proteins.
  - Each sequence of three nucleotides (codon) in mRNA codes for one specific amino acid.
  - There are 64 possible codons (since 4 bases × 4 bases × 4 bases = 64), but only 20 amino acids, so some amino acids are coded by more than one codon.

## 21.4 Mutations
- **Mutation**: A change in the DNA sequence that can affect protein production.
  - **Point Mutation**: A change in a single nucleotide base (e.g., substitution, insertion, or deletion).
  - **Frameshift Mutation**: Insertion or deletion of a base that shifts the reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids.
  - **Silent Mutation**: A mutation that does not change the amino acid sequence.
  - **Nonsense Mutation**: A mutation that creates a stop codon, leading to an incomplete protein.

## 21.5 Biotechnology
- **Biotechnology**: The use of living organisms or biological systems to develop products or processes for specific uses.
  - **Applications of Biotechnology**:
    1. **Genetic Engineering**: The manipulation of an organism's DNA to achieve desirable traits.
       - **Recombinant DNA**: DNA molecules formed by combining genes from different organisms.
       - **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)**: Organisms whose DNA has been altered for desired traits (e.g., pest-resistant crops, insulin-producing bacteria).
    2. **Cloning**: Creating an organism that is genetically identical to another (e.g., therapeutic cloning for stem cell research).
    3. **Gene Therapy**: Inserting, altering, or removing genes within an organism's cells to treat disease.

## 21.6 Applications of Genetic Engineering
1. **Medicine**:  
   - **Production of Insulin**: Genetically modified bacteria can produce human insulin for the treatment of diabetes.
   - **Gene Therapy**: Inserting a healthy gene into a patient's cells to treat genetic disorders.
2. **Agriculture**:  
   - **GM Crops**: Crops can be genetically modified to improve yield, resist pests, or tolerate environmental stresses.
   - **Golden Rice**: A genetically engineered rice that contains vitamin A to combat vitamin A deficiency.
3. **Forensics**:  
   - **DNA Profiling**: Used in criminal investigations and paternity testing.

## 21.7 Ethical Issues in Biotechnology
- **Ethical Concerns**:  
   1. **GMOs in Agriculture**: Concerns about the long-term environmental impact and health risks.
   2. **Cloning and Stem Cell Research**: Issues surrounding the morality of cloning and using embryonic stem cells for research.
   3. **Gene Therapy**: Ethical debates over the alteration of human genes and the potential for “designer babies.”
