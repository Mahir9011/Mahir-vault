## 14.1 Types of Reproduction
- **Asexual Reproduction**: Involves one parent, offspring are genetically identical.
- **Sexual Reproduction**: Involves two parents, offspring have genetic variation.

## 14.2 Asexual Reproduction
- **Methods**:
  1. **Vegetative Propagation**: New plants from parts like stems or roots.
  2. **Budding**: Small part of the plant grows into a new organism.
  3. **Spore Formation**: E.g., in ferns, spores are released and grow into new plants.

## 14.3 Sexual Reproduction
- **Gametes**: Male (pollen) and female (ovule) reproductive cells.
- **Pollination**: Transfer of pollen from male to female organs.
- **Fertilization**: Fusion of male and female gametes.
- **Seed Dispersal**: Methods: Wind, animals, water, explosive.

## 14.4 Structure of Flowers
| **Part of Flower** | **Function**                                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Stigma              | Receives pollen.                                   |
| Style               | Connects stigma to the ovary.                     |
| Ovary               | Contains ovules, where fertilization occurs.      |
| Anther              | Produces pollen.                                   |
| Filament            | Supports the anther.                              |
| Petals              | Attract pollinators.                              |
| Sepals              | Protect the flower bud.                           |

## 14.5 Pollination
- **Self-Pollination**: Pollen from the same flower.
- **Cross-Pollination**: Pollen from different flowers.

## 14.6 Fertilization
- Pollen fertilizes the ovule, forming a zygote that develops into a seed.

## 14.7 Germination
- **Conditions**: Water, oxygen, warmth.
- **Stages**: Seed absorbs water → Breaks seed coat → Root and shoot emerge.
