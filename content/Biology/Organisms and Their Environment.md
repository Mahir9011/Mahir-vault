## 17.1 What is an Ecosystem?
- **Ecosystem**: A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.
  - **Biotic Factors**: All living things in an ecosystem, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms.
  - **Abiotic Factors**: Non-living factors in the environment, such as temperature, light, water, and soil.

## 17.2 Energy Flow in Ecosystems
- **Producers**: Organisms, mostly plants, that make their own food through photosynthesis using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. 
  - **Examples**: Green plants, algae, and some bacteria.
- **Consumers**: Organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy. They are classified into:
  1. **Primary Consumers**: Herbivores that eat producers (plants).
  2. **Secondary Consumers**: Carnivores that eat herbivores.
  3. **Tertiary Consumers**: Carnivores that eat other carnivores.

**Food Chains**: Show a linear flow of energy.  
Example:  
- Grass → Rabbit → Fox.

**Food Webs**: A complex network of food chains that shows how different species are interconnected in an ecosystem.

## 17.3 Nutrient Cycling
- **Nutrient Cycling**: The process of recycling elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus through an ecosystem, ensuring that they are reused by living organisms.
  
### Carbon Cycle:
1. **Photosynthesis**: Plants absorb CO₂ and produce glucose.
2. **Respiration**: Organisms release CO₂ back into the atmosphere through respiration.
3. **Decomposition**: Decomposers break down dead organisms, releasing carbon into the soil.
4. **Combustion**: The burning of fossil fuels releases CO₂ into the atmosphere.

### Nitrogen Cycle:
1. **Nitrogen Fixation**: Bacteria in the soil or in the root nodules of legumes convert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into nitrates (NO₃⁻) that plants can use.
2. **Nitrification**: Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonium (NH₄⁺) into nitrates.
3. **Denitrification**: Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates back to nitrogen gas (N₂), which is released into the atmosphere.

## 17.4 Adaptation to the Environment
- **Adaptations**: Traits that help organisms survive and reproduce in their specific environment.
  - **Structural Adaptations**: Physical features that improve survival.
    - Example: A giraffe’s long neck for reaching high branches.
  - **Behavioral Adaptations**: Actions organisms take to survive.
    - Example: Birds migrating to warmer climates during winter.
  - **Physiological Adaptations**: Internal processes that help organisms survive.
    - Example: The ability of camels to conserve water in hot deserts.

## 17.5 Population and Community
- **Population**: A group of organisms of the same species living in a specific area at a given time.
- **Community**: All the different populations of species living and interacting in the same area.

## 17.6 Human Impact on Ecosystems
- **Deforestation**: The large-scale removal of forests for agriculture, urban development, or logging. This leads to loss of biodiversity, increased CO₂ levels, and disruption of local ecosystems.
- **Pollution**: The contamination of air, water, and soil with harmful substances.  
  - Air Pollution: Caused by emissions from vehicles and industries.
  - Water Pollution: Chemicals, sewage, and waste products polluting water bodies.
  - Soil Pollution: Pesticides, fertilizers, and industrial waste harming soil.
- **Climate Change**: The result of human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, leading to global warming and severe weather events.
- **Overfishing**: Catching fish at a rate faster than they can reproduce, leading to depletion of fish populations and disrupting marine ecosystems.

## 17.7 Conservation
- **Conservation**: The protection and management of biodiversity to ensure that natural resources are used sustainably.
  - **In-situ Conservation**: Protecting species in their natural habitats.
    - Example: National parks and wildlife reserves.
  - **Ex-situ Conservation**: Protecting species outside their natural habitats.
    - Example: Zoos, botanical gardens, and seed banks.
  - **Sustainable Resource Management**: Managing resources (like water, forests, fisheries) so they can regenerate and support future generations.

## 17.8 Ecological Pyramids
- **Pyramid of Numbers**: Shows the number of organisms at each trophic level in a food chain.
  - Typically, the number of producers is higher than consumers.
- **Pyramid of Biomass**: Shows the total dry mass of organisms at each trophic level.
  - Decreases as you move up the pyramid.
- **Pyramid of Energy**: Shows the flow of energy through an ecosystem, with the most energy available at the producer level.
