- **Glucagon**: Raises blood glucose by stimulating glycogen breakdown.

## 11.3 Regulation of Body Temperature
- **Thermoregulation**: Maintaining body temperature around 37Â°C.

  - **Vasodilation**: Blood vessels widen to release heat.
  - **Vasoconstriction**: Blood vessels narrow to retain heat.
  - **Sweating**: Evaporation of sweat cools the body.
