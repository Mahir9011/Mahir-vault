## 19.1 Types of Diseases
- **Infectious Diseases**: Caused by pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.
- **Non-Infectious Diseases**: Caused by factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions (e.g., cancer, heart disease).

## 19.2 Pathogens and Disease Transmission
- **Pathogens**: Microorganisms that cause disease.
- **Transmission Methods**:
  1. **Direct Contact**: Physical contact (e.g., common cold).
  2. **Airborne**: Coughing or sneezing (e.g., influenza).
  3. **Waterborne**: Contaminated water (e.g., cholera).
  4. **Vector-Borne**: Spread by animals (e.g., malaria).

## 19.3 The Immune System
- **White Blood Cells (WBCs)**: Defend the body by engulfing pathogens (phagocytosis) or producing antibodies.
- **Antibodies**: Proteins that target and neutralize pathogens.
- **Memory Cells**: Retain information about pathogens for faster responses.

## 19.4 Vaccination
- **Vaccination**: Introduction of a harmless form of the pathogen to stimulate an immune response and protect against future infections.

## 19.5 Antibiotics and Antivirals
- **Antibiotics**: Used to treat bacterial infections.
- **Antivirals**: Used to treat viral infections.
- **Resistance**: Overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

## 19.6 Cancer
- **Cancer**: Uncontrolled cell growth leading to tumor formation.
- **Causes**: Genetic mutations, environmental factors (e.g., smoking).
- **Treatment**: Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
