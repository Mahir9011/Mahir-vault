## 15.1 What is Inheritance?
- **Definition**: Passing of traits from parents to offspring through genes.
- **Genes**: Sequences of DNA that code for proteins.
- **Chromosomes**: Structures that carry genes.

## 15.2 Mendelian Inheritance
- **Dominant Alleles**: Expressed in the presence of another allele.
- **Recessive Alleles**: Expressed only if two copies are present.
- **Mendel's Laws**:  
  1. **Law of Segregation**: Alleles separate during gamete formation.
  2. **Law of Independent Assortment**: Genes for different traits are inherited independently.

## 15.3 Genotype and Phenotype
- **Genotype**: Genetic makeup (e.g., Aa, AA).
- **Phenotype**: Observable traits (e.g., brown eyes).

## 15.4 Punnett Squares
- Tool to predict genetic inheritance.
- Example: Cross of two heterozygous pea plants (Aa x Aa) produces 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa.

## 15.5 Sex-Linked Inheritance
- Traits linked to **X chromosome** (e.g., hemophilia).
- More common in males (XY) than females (XX).

## 15.6 Mutation
- **Definition**: Change in DNA sequence.
- Types:
  1. **Point Mutation**: Change in a single nucleotide.
  2. **Frameshift Mutation**: Insertion or deletion of a base.

## 15.7 Genetic Disorders
- **Cystic Fibrosis**: Recessive disorder, affects lungs and digestion.
- **Sickle Cell Anemia**: Recessive disorder, causes abnormal hemoglobin.
