## 16.1 What is Variation?
- **Definition**: Differences between individuals in a population.
- **Types**:  
  1. **Genetic Variation**: Differences in genes or alleles.
  2. **Environmental Variation**: Differences due to environmental factors.

## 16.2 Genetic Variation
- **Causes**:  
  1. **Mutations**: Changes in DNA sequence.
  2. **Sexual Reproduction**: Genetic mixing during fertilization.
  3. **Crossing Over**: Exchange of genetic material during meiosis.

## 16.3 Natural Selection
- **Definition**: Survival of organisms with advantageous traits.
- **Steps**:
  1. Variation exists.
  2. Advantageous traits increase survival.
  3. More offspring inherit these traits.

## 16.4 Adaptation
- **Structural**: Physical features that help organisms survive (e.g., camouflaged fur).
- **Behavioral**: Actions that help survival (e.g., migration).
- **Physiological**: Internal processes that help survival (e.g., water conservation in desert plants).

## 16.5 Artificial Selection
- **Definition**: Human-driven breeding for specific traits.
- **Examples**: Dog breeding, crop improvement.

## 16.6 Speciation
- **Definition**: Formation of new species due to genetic divergence.
- **Process**: Isolation → Genetic divergence → Reproductive isolation.

## 16.7 Evidence for Evolution
- **Fossils**, **Comparative Anatomy**, **Embryology**, and **Molecular Evidence** support evolution.
