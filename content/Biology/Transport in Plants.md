## 8.1 Importance of Transport in Plants
- **Transport Systems**: Xylem (water and minerals), Phloem (sugars).

## 8.2 Xylem and Phloem
| **Tissue**           | **Structure**                      | **Function**                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Xylem                | Dead cells with thick walls        | Transports water and minerals upwards.  |
| Phloem               | Living cells with sieve plates     | Transports sugars and amino acids.      |

## 8.3 Water Uptake by Roots
- **Root Hair Cells**: Absorb water and minerals from the soil.
- **Osmosis**: Water moves from higher to lower water potential.

## 8.4 Movement of Water through the Plant
- **Transpiration Pull**: Water evaporates from leaves, pulling more water up through the xylem.

## 8.5 Transpiration
- **Definition**: Loss of water vapor from leaves via stomata.
- **Factors Affecting Transpiration**:
  - Temperature, humidity, wind, and light intensity.

## 8.6 Translocation
- Movement of sugars and amino acids in phloem from source (leaves) to sink (roots, fruits).
