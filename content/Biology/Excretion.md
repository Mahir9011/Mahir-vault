## 10.1 What is Excretion?
- **Definition**: The process of removing waste products from the body.
- **Waste Products**: Urea, Carbon Dioxide, Excess Water.

## 10.2 The Human Excretory System
| **Part**               | **Function**                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Kidneys                | Filter blood, remove urea, water, salts.|
| Ureters                | Transport urine from kidneys to bladder.|
| Bladder                | Stores urine.                           |
| Urethra                | Expels urine from the body.            |

## 10.3 The Nephron
- **Functional Unit** of the kidney.
- **Functions**: Filtration, reabsorption, secretion.

## 10.4 Ultrafiltration
- Blood is filtered at high pressure in the glomerulus into Bowman's capsule, removing small molecules (e.g., urea).

## 10.5 Reabsorption
- Glucose, water, and ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate in the proximal convoluted tubule.

## 10.6 Secretion
- Waste products like excess ions and drugs are secreted into the nephron for excretion.

## 10.7 Osmoregulation
- **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone)** controls water reabsorption to regulate water balance.
