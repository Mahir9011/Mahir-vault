## 1.1 Structure of Living Organisms
- **Cells**: Basic unit of life.
- Two types of cells:
  - **Animal Cells** 
  - **Plant Cells**

| **Cell Structure** | **Function**                                  | **Found in**     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Cell Membrane      | Controls movement of substances               | Plant and Animal |
| Cytoplasm          | Site of chemical reactions                    | Plant and Animal |
| Nucleus            | Controls cell activities, contains DNA        | Plant and Animal |
| Mitochondria       | Site of aerobic respiration                   | Plant and Animal |
| Ribosomes          | Synthesize proteins                           | Plant and Animal |
| Cell Wall          | Provides structure (cellulose)                | Plant            |
| Chloroplasts       | Site of photosynthesis (contains chlorophyll) | Plant            |
| Vacuole            | Stores water, nutrients, and waste            | Plant            |

## 1.2 Cell Specialization
- **Specialized Cells**: Adapted for specific functions.
- Examples:
  - **Red Blood Cell**: No nucleus, biconcave shape, carries oxygen.
  - **Root Hair Cell**: Large surface area, absorbs water and minerals.
  - **Nerve Cell**: Long with branches, transmits electrical signals.
  - **Ciliated Cell**: Has cilia, sweeps mucus in airways.

## 1.3 Levels of Organization
- **Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ Systems → Organism**.

## 1.4 Differences Between Plant and Animal Cells

| **Feature** | **Plant Cell** | **Animal Cell** |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Cell Wall   | Present         | Absent          |
| Chloroplasts| Present         | Absent          |
| Vacuole     | Large and central | Small or absent |
| Shape       | Fixed, rectangular | Irregular      |

## 1.5 Magnification
- **Formula**:  $\text{Magnification} = \frac{\text{Image size}}{\text{Actual size}}$
