## 7.1 The Circulatory System
- **Double Circulation**: Humans have a double circulatory system.
  - **Pulmonary Circulation**: Blood from the heart to the lungs and back.
  - **Systemic Circulation**: Blood from the heart to the body and back.

## 7.2 Structure of the Heart
| **Part**                | **Function**                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Right Atrium            | Receives deoxygenated blood from the body.            |
| Right Ventricle         | Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs.                |
| Left Atrium             | Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs.             |
| Left Ventricle          | Pumps oxygenated blood to the body.                   |
| Valves                  | Prevent backflow of blood.                            |
| Aorta                   | Carries oxygenated blood to the body.                 |
| Vena Cava               | Brings deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart. |
| Pulmonary Artery        | Carries blood from the heart to the lungs.            |
| Pulmonary Vein          | Carries blood from the lungs to the heart.            |

## 7.3 Blood Vessels
| **Vessel**              | **Structure**                      | **Function**                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Arteries                | Thick walls, narrow lumen          | Carry blood away from the heart.        |
| Veins                   | Thin walls, large lumen, valves    | Carry blood to the heart.               |
| Capillaries             | Thin walls (one cell thick)        | Exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste. |

## 7.4 Blood and its Components
| **Component**           | **Function**                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Red Blood Cells         | Carry oxygen using hemoglobin.         |
| White Blood Cells       | Fight infection.                        |
| Platelets               | Help blood clot.                        |
| Plasma                  | Transports nutrients, gases, hormones. |
