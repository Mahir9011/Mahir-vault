## 20.1 The Cell Cycle
- The cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and replication.
  - **Interphase**: The cell grows, replicates DNA, and prepares for division.
    - **G1 Phase**: Cell growth and normal function.
    - **S Phase**: DNA replication.
    - **G2 Phase**: Preparation for mitosis.
  - **Mitosis**: The process of nuclear division resulting in two identical daughter cells.
  - **Cytokinesis**: The division of the cytoplasm to form two separate daughter cells.

## 20.2 Mitosis
- **Stages of Mitosis**:
  1. **Prophase**: Chromosomes condense and become visible, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and spindle fibers form.
  2. **Metaphase**: Chromosomes align at the cell's equator.
  3. **Anaphase**: Sister chromatids are pulled apart toward opposite poles of the cell.
  4. **Telophase**: Nuclear membranes reform around the separated chromatids.
  5. **Cytokinesis**: The cytoplasm divides, forming two daughter cells.

- **Purpose of Mitosis**: Growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.

## 20.3 Meiosis
- **Meiosis**: A type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four non-identical gametes (sperm and egg).
- **Stages of Meiosis**:
  1. **Meiosis I**: Homologous chromosomes are separated, reducing chromosome number by half.
  2. **Meiosis II**: Sister chromatids are separated, similar to mitosis.

## 20.4 Genetic Variation in Meiosis
- **Crossing Over**: Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I of meiosis, creating genetic variation.
- **Independent Assortment**: The random distribution of chromosomes during metaphase I, which leads to genetic variation in gametes.
