## 12.1 What is Coordination and Response?
- **Coordination**: The process by which organisms respond to changes in their internal and external environments.
- **Systems Involved**: Nervous and endocrine systems.

## 12.2 The Nervous System
- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Brain and spinal cord.
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: Nerves connecting CNS to the rest of the body.
- **Neuron**: A specialized cell that transmits electrical impulses.

| **Part of Neuron** | **Function**                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Dendrites          | Receive impulses from other cells.        |
| Axon               | Transmits impulses away from the cell body.|
| Myelin Sheath      | Insulates axons, speeds up impulse transmission. |
| Synapse            | The gap between two neurons.              |

## 12.3 Reflex Action
- **Definition**: A quick, involuntary response to a stimulus.
- **Example**: Pulling hand away from a hot object.
- **Reflex Arc**: Stimulus → Receptor → Sensory Neuron → Spinal Cord → Motor Neuron → Effector (muscle).

## 12.4 Hormonal Coordination
- **Endocrine System**: Produces hormones that regulate various body functions.
- **Pituitary Gland**: Master gland, controls other glands.
- **Thyroid Gland**: Produces thyroxine, controls metabolism.
- **Adrenal Glands**: Produce adrenaline for the fight-or-flight response.

## 12.5 Plant Responses
- **Phototropism**: Growth towards light.
- **Gravitropism**: Growth in response to gravity.
- **Auxins**: Plant hormones that control growth in response to environmental stimuli.
