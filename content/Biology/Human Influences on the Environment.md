## 18.1 Pollution
- **Pollution**: The introduction of harmful substances or products into the environment that adversely affect ecosystems and human health.
  
### Types of Pollution:
1. **Air Pollution**: Release of harmful gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter.
   - **Sources**: Factories, vehicles, and burning of fossil fuels.
2. **Water Pollution**: Contamination of water bodies by chemicals, heavy metals, sewage, and plastic waste.
   - **Sources**: Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage.
3. **Soil Pollution**: Contamination of the soil with chemicals, waste products, and pesticides.
   - **Sources**: Industrial waste, agricultural chemicals, and improper disposal of waste.

### Effects of Pollution:
- **Health Problems**: Respiratory diseases, cancer, and other health issues.
- **Ecosystem Disruption**: Harm to wildlife, plants, and habitats.

## 18.2 Global Warming and Climate Change
- **Global Warming**: Increase in Earth’s average temperature due to the greenhouse effect.
- **Greenhouse Gases**: CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide trap heat in the atmosphere.
- **Causes**:
  1. **Burning Fossil Fuels**: Releases CO₂.
  2. **Deforestation**: Reduces the absorption of CO₂ by trees.
  3. **Agriculture**: Livestock release methane.

**Effects of Global Warming**:
1. Rising sea levels due to melting ice caps.
2. More frequent and severe weather events.
3. Habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity.

## 18.3 Acid Rain
- **Formation**: SO₂ and NOx gases react with water vapor to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which fall as acid rain.
- **Effects**:
  1. **Damage to Ecosystems**: Acidifies water bodies, making them uninhabitable.
  2. **Soil Degradation**: Leaches minerals from the soil.
  3. **Building Damage**: Corrodes buildings and monuments.

## 18.4 Deforestation
- **Deforestation**: The large-scale clearing of forests for agriculture, urban development, and logging.
- **Effects**:
  1. Loss of biodiversity.
  2. Contribution to global warming (fewer trees to absorb CO₂).
  3. Soil erosion and reduced water retention.

## 18.5 Overfishing
- **Overfishing**: Harvesting fish at a rate faster than they can reproduce.
- **Effects**:
  1. Depletion of fish populations.
  2. Disruption of marine ecosystems.
  3. Economic impact on fishing communities.

## 18.6 Conservation Efforts
- **Conservation**: Protecting and preserving natural resources and biodiversity.
- **Methods**:
  1. **In-situ Conservation**: Protecting species in their natural habitat.
  2. **Ex-situ Conservation**: Protecting species outside their natural habitat (e.g., zoos).
  3. **Sustainable Development**: Using resources at a rate that allows for their regeneration and supports future generations.
