## 2.1 Types of Movement of Substances
- **Diffusion**: Movement of particles from high to low concentration.
- **Osmosis**: Movement of water from high water potential to low water potential through a semi-permeable membrane.
- **Active Transport**: Movement of particles against a concentration gradient using energy (ATP).
## 2.2 Diffusion
- **Factors Affecting Diffusion**:
  - **Concentration Gradient**: Faster diffusion with a steeper gradient.
  - **Temperature**: Faster diffusion at higher temperatures.
  - **Surface Area**: Larger surface area = faster diffusion.
  - **Distance**: Shorter distance = faster diffusion.
## 2.3 Osmosis
- **Example**: Root hair cells absorbing water from soil.
- **Effects on Cells**:
  - **Animal Cells**: In pure water, they may burst (lysis). In concentrated solutions, they shrink (crenation).
  - **Plant Cells**: Become turgid (firm) in pure water, plasmolyze (shrink) in concentrated solutions.
## 2.4 Active Transport
- **Example**: Absorption of minerals by root cells.
- **Requires energy**: From respiration.
## 2.5 Importance of Movement of Substances
- **Diffusion**: Gas exchange (O2, CO2) in lungs.
- **Osmosis**: Maintains water balance in cells.
- **Active Transport**: Uptake of minerals against concentration gradients.
